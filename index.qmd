## Description

The CDISC Analysis Results Data (ARD) Model is an emerging standard for encoding statistical analysis summaries in a machine-readable format. Its primary objective is to streamline the processes of automation, ensuring reproducibility, promoting reusability, and enhancing traceability.
The newly released {cards} R package, a collaborative effort including Roche, GSK, and Novartis, offers a variety of functions for ARD generation. These range from basic univariate summaries like means and tabulations to complex multivariable summaries encompassing regression models and statistical tests.
In this interactive workshop, attendees will learn about ARDs and how they fit into the larger CDISC Analysis Results Standard. They will get hands-on experience using {cards} to build ARDs for both simple and complex statistical summaries. Lastly, attendees will also be introduced to open-source tools for converting their ARDs into tables using the {gtsummary} and {tfrmt} R packages. Attendees will leave with a solid understanding of ARDs and the knowledge of how to integrate them into their daily work using open-source tools.
