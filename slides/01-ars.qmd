## Analysis Results Standard (ARS)

-   Emerging standard for **prospectively** encoding statistical analysis reporting pipeline in a machine-readable format.

-   Primary objectives are to leverage analysis results metadata to drive the automation of results and support storage, access, processing, traceability and reproducibility of results.

-   Logical model that describes analysis results and associated metadata.

-   Focus on concepts, _not layout_, e.g. the summary statistics, not how the results are shown in a table.

## Analysis Results Data (ARD)

* Encodes statistical analysis outcomes in a machine-readable format.

* Primary objective is to streamline the processes of automation, ensuring reproducibility, promoting reusability, and enhancing traceability.

* The ARD model specified how statistical results are saved into a structured format.

* The ARD can be used to to subsequently create tables and figures.


## Analysis Results Data (ARD)

* After the initial creation of an ARD, the results can later be re-used again and again for subsequent reporting needs.

## A few notes about ARDs

* QC is done on raw value 
    * You don’t have to waste time trying to match formatting to match QC

* But… 
    * QC will be more sensitive to floating point
    * QC tolerance will need to be defined

* ARD can be saved as a dataset (rds, xpt, etc) or json file
