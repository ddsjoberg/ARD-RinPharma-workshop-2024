## Workshop outline

1. Introduction to the Analysis Results Standard and {cards}

2. Introduction to the {cardx} Package and ARD Extras

3. ARD to Tables with {gtsummary}

4. ARD to Tables with {tfrmt}

## Working environment

-   For consistency, we will be working in RStudio Cloud  

-   Everything has been installed and set up for you 

-   You can also opt to work in local RStudio

-   Following the course, all content from this workshop will be available on the course website and GitHub 


## Quick warm-up

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 5, play_sound = TRUE)
```

-   If using Posit Cloud:

    -   Navigate to Posit Cloud link

    -   Click on the Project to make a personal copy
  
-   If using local RStudio:

    -   Exercises can be found here: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/ARD-RinPharma-workshop-2024/exercises.html

- Open `exercises/01-warmup.R`

- Complete the exercise


## Solution for `00-warmup.R`

Using dplyr:
 
- From the ADSL dataset:
- Subset to the safety population (SAFFL == "Y")
- calculate the number of unique subjects in each treatment group (TRT01A)  

```{r}
library(dplyr)

pharmaverseadam::adsl |> 
  filter(SAFFL == "Y") |> 
  count(TRT01A)
```

# Analysis Results Standard

## Analysis Results Standard (ARS)

## Analysis Results Standard (ARS)

::: {.incremental}

-   Emerging standard for **prospectively** encoding statistical analysis reporting pipeline in a machine-readable format.

-   Logical model that describes analysis results and associated metadata.

-   Primary objectives:

    -   Leverage analysis results **metadata** to drive **automation** of results 
  
    -   Support storage, access, processing, traceability and reproducibility of results

## Analysis Results Standard (ARS)

Example ARS Flow

![](images/ars-example-flow.png){fig-align="center"}

- The ARS provides a metadata-driven infrastructure for analysis

## Analysis Results Standard (ARS)

Example ARS Flow

![](images/ars-example-flow-with-hex.png){fig-align="center"}

- The ARS provides a metadata-driven infrastructure for analysis

- {cards} serves as the engine for the analysis 

## Analysis Results Data (ARD)

::: {.incremental}

-   Encodes statistical analysis outcomes in a machine-readable format.

-   The ARD model specifies how statistical results are saved into a structured format.

-   The ARD can be used to to subsequently create tables and figures.

-   The ARD does *not* describe the layout of the results

:::

## Analysis Results Data (ARD)

* After the initial creation of an ARD, the results can later be re-used again and again for subsequent reporting needs.

## A few notes about ARDs

:::{.incremental}

-   Rethinking QC

    -   QC can be focused on the raw value, not the formatted display
  
        -   You don’t have to waste time trying to match formatting to match QC
    
        -   But...QC will be more sensitive to floating point
    
-   Flexible data file types

    -   ARD can be saved as a dataset (rds, xpt, etc) or json file
