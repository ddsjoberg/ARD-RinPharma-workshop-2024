# Analysis Results Standard

## Analysis Results Standard (ARS)

## Analysis Results Standard (ARS)

::: {.incremental}

-   Emerging standard for **prospectively** encoding statistical analysis reporting pipeline in a machine-readable format.

-   Logical model that describes analysis results and associated metadata.

-   Primary objectives:

    -   Leverage analysis results **metadata** to drive **automation** of results 
  
    -   Support storage, access, processing, traceability and reproducibility of results

## Analysis Results Data (ARD)

::: {.incremental}

-   Encodes statistical analysis outcomes in a machine-readable format.

-   The ARD model specifies how statistical results are saved into a structured format.

-   The ARD can be used to to subsequently create tables and figures.

-   The ARD does *not* describe the layout of the results

:::

## Analysis Results Data (ARD)

* After the initial creation of an ARD, the results can later be re-used again and again for subsequent reporting needs.

## A few notes about ARDs

:::{.incremental}

-   Rethinking QC

    -   QC can be focused on the raw value, not the formatted display
  
        -   You don’t have to waste time trying to match formatting to match QC
    
        -   But...QC will be more sensitive to floating point
    
-   Flexible data file types

    -   ARD can be saved as a dataset (rds, xpt, etc) or json file
